CONTEXT FOR AGENTS:
  chv is a CLI to work with local ClickHouse and ClickHouse Cloud.

  Two main workflows:
  1. Local: Install and interact with versions of ClickHouse to develop locally.
  2. Cloud: Manage ClickHouse Cloud infrastructure and push local work to cloud.

  You can install the ClickHouse Agent Skills for best practices on using ClikHouse:

  `npx skills add clickhouse/agent-skills`

  Typical local workflow: `chv install stable && chv use stable && chv run server`.
